The capacity to recognize human activities has
become increasingly important in last years and is going to
be even more relevant for the future, due to the widespread
of smart/IoT devices, whose utility consists in human activity
recognition. In order to tackle this task various deep learning
models, sensors selection, data segmentation and hand-crafted
features were used in past researches, but always separately,
without exploiting the synergy resulting from the combination
of these techniques. We are going to fill this lack, combining
together the best ideas found so far in the literature, with two
main goals: find if it exists a model capable to significantly
improve the best performances found so far (regardless of
computational cost) and find a model capable to preserve good
performances using the least amount of features. In both cases,
we test the models also with a noisy test set, showing their
robustness to artifacts. Regarding the first goal, we found a deep
learning architecture in line with the best performances existing;
regarding the second goal, we found that it is possible to reduce
the number of features used by 60%, suffering a reduction in
performance (F1-score) smaller than 2%. This could be useful for
a wide range of devices which need to classify human gestures
with a good reliability but with low energy consumption and
data requirement.
